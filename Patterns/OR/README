**NOTE**
Do not use the weights and/or seed from this directory in
your submission for this assignment -- they are here as
examples only (generate your own!).   Feel free to use
the 'or.pat' file, however.
********

To create all of the files present in this directory, the
'or.pat' file was first constructed, and then 'perceptron'
was called twice.   Below is an exerpt from the typescript 
of the actual session : 


bonzo % ls or.*
or.pat 

bonzo % perceptron -p or.pat -S or.seed -s or.wts
epoch   1 :  patterns incorrect =   1
epoch   2 :  patterns incorrect =   2
epoch   3 :  patterns incorrect =   1
epoch   4 :  patterns incorrect =   0

bonzo % ls or.*
or.pat    or.seed    or.wts

bonzo % perceptron -p or.pat -l or.wts -t or.out

bonzo % ls or.*
or.out  or.pat  or.seed  or.wts
